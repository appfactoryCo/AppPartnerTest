# This app developed for App Partner company in New York as part of their programmer test.

It's in Objective-C and here are the details:

APP SECTIONS

- Home: This is a very simple screen, all it does is have buttons that lead you to the other screen in the app.

- Chat: This section simply displays a list of an old chat log from some cached data, however the user images in the chat
must be dynamically downloaded from the provided urls.

- Login: This is your typical mobile app's login screen, where a user enters their credentials and attempts to login. Details
on what HTTP Endpoint to query and what the UI should do upon a successful login are specified inside the wireframe.pdf

- Animation Test: The basic requirements for this screen is that when the spin button is tapped
